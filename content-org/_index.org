Hey, I'm Nilay.

I'm a data scientist and former mathematician with pretty broad interests. I
like learning about and creating new things. Sometimes I even write things down.

Recently I've been interested in [[https://scienceforthepeople.org/][political economy]], the climate, and the
[[https://nilay.ink/kanji-stroke-order/][Japanese]] language. I'm also starting to learn a bit about permacomputing, emacs,
and C.

You can get in touch with me via email [[mailto:nilaykumar@tutanota.com][here]], and you can find the code for this
site [[https://github.com/nilaykumar/nilaykumar.github.io][GitHub]] (though I am looking to move).

Below are some math notes that might be of interest:
- My Ph.D. [[file:~/Documents/projects/nilaykumar.github.io/static/pdf/nilay_kumar_thesis.pdf][thesis]] in mathematical physics, written under the guidance of Ezra
  Getzler, concerns a new construction of the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) Laplacian
  using the methods of homological perturbation theory. (August 3, 2021)
- Rough notes on [[file:~/Documents/projects/nilaykumar.github.io/static/pdf/sms.pdf][lectures]] given by various speakers on derived geometry at the Fields
  Institute. (Summer 2018)
- Rough notes on Mihnea Popa's [[file:~/Documents/projects/nilaykumar.github.io/static/pdf/complex_geometry.pdf][course]] on complex geometry. (Winter/Spring 2018)
- Lightning [[file:~/Documents/projects/nilaykumar.github.io/static/pdf/gss_talk.pdf][talk]] on the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. (September 22, 2017)
- Rough notes from John Francis' course on [[file:~/Documents/projects/nilaykumar.github.io/static/pdf/factorization_homology.pdf][factorization homology]]. (Fall 2017)
- Notes for a [[file:~/Documents/projects/nilaykumar.github.io/static/pdf/chernweiltheory.pdf][talk]] on Chern-Weil theory in John Francis' Milnor seminar. (April
  10, 2017)
- An informal reading group on WKB methods led to this [[file:~/Documents/projects/nilaykumar.github.io/static/pdf/fukayaConjecture.pdf][talk]] on Witten's de Rham
  approach to Morse theory, and Fukaya's reinterpretation in terms of
  A-infinity categories. (March 22, 2017)
- I gave a talk on the symplectic geometry behind [[file:~/Documents/projects/nilaykumar.github.io/static/pdf/symplectic_background.pdf][classical mechanics]] (with an
  eye towards moment maps and Noether's theorem) for a seminar on the BV
  formalism, run by Sean Pohorence. (January 10, 2017)
- In one of the many Kan seminars run by John Francis, I gave a talk sketching
  [[file:~/Documents/projects/nilaykumar.github.io/static/pdf/bousfield_localization.pdf][Bousfield's construction]] of the localization of spaces with respect to
  homology equivalences. I seem to have avoided discussing all the hard parts of
  the construction. I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed. (November 30, 2016)
- For a seminar on Reshetikin-Turaev invariants, led by Theo Johnson-Freyd, I
  gave a talk on the [[file:~/Documents/projects/nilaykumar.github.io/static/pdf/gq_cs.pdf][geometric quantization]] of Chern-Simons theory (according to
  Axelrod, della Pietra, and Witten). (January 13, 2016)
- I spent a bit of time learning about the basics of symplectic geometry as a
  first-year graduate student under Eric Zaslow's patient eye and I took some
  [[file:~/Documents/projects/nilaykumar.github.io/static/pdf/notes_symp.pdf][notes]] in the process. (December 11, 2015)
