Hi! I'm Nilay.

I'm a data scientist and former mathematician with pretty broad interests. I
like learning about and creating new things. Sometimes I write things down and
put them on my blog.

Recently I've been thinking about natural language processing, Hochschild
homology, political economy, and learning Japanese.

You can get in touch with me via email [[mailto:nilaykumar@tutanota.com][here]].
