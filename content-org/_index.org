Hi! I'm Nilay.

I'm a data scientist and former mathematician with pretty broad interests. I
like learning about and creating new things. Sometimes I write things down and
put them on my blog.

Recently I've been interested in [[https://scienceforthepeople.org/][political economy]], the climate, and the
Japanese language. I'm also starting to learn a bit about permacomputing,
intentionality, and emacs.

You can get in touch with me via email [[mailto:nilaykumar@tutanota.com][here]]. You can find the code for this site
