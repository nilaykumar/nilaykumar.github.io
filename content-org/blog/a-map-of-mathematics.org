A few years ago, it must have been, I came across a fantasy-style illustrated
map of physics by field and subfield that I thought was a great overview of the
landscape of physics research. I can't quite remember where I saw it or who had
made it, but here's a few that I've found that I quite like.

The first is a beautiful 1939 map made by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bern_Porter][Bern Porter]], drawn only slightly
stylized, with important concepts of physics labelled in large print and
notable physicists' names written in as villages along a coast ("daring souls
who venture there"):

To a certain extent, similar ideas (and physicists who worked on those ideas)
are placed close together, with a river marked "energy" -- in its various forms
-- flowing through the landscape and cutting out islands.

Here's a more recent rendition by science educator and YouTuber [[https://dominicwalliman.com/][Dominic Walliman]]
(who has a number of such maps for different subjects) which is much more
stylized and conceptual:

[[file:a-map-of-mathematics/walliman-physics-jpg.jpg]]

In this rendition, the spatial proximity of subfields is not as closely linked
to conceptual proximity (whatever that means), although the "chasm of ignorance"
that separates general relativity from quantum field theory and the standard
model seems to me pretty reasonable. I think this map is definitely more
educational, though I do enjoy Porter's rather traditional cartographic
yellow-on-blue style.

* maps of mathematics

So I got to thinking -- what would a map of mathematics look like? Can we
organize various subfields of pure mathematics into a 2-dimensional cartographic
representation in which the areas that interact with each other more frequently
are closer? And how exactly would we quantify "conceptual proximity"? Before we
get to answering these questions, let's take a look at some already-existing
maps of mathematics.

Here's Walliman's map on mathematics, which is styled very similarly to his map
of physics:

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt alt-text here

There's also this map (and [[https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/6479/a-graph-map-of-math-se][variations]]) by Piotr Migdal, which is more accurately
a map of question tags on Mathematics Stack Exchange:

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt alt-text here
#+caption: caption here
[[file:a-map-of-mathematics/migdal-map.jpg]]

This map is definitely heavily influenced by the nature of Math Stack Exchange
being a question and answer site comprised of mostly non-research oriented
questions. I'd expect linear algebra, for instance (as commenters on the Math SE
post noted) to be much more central, but questions with the =linear-algebra= tag
generally don't tend to be tagged with =abstract-algebra= or =functional-analysis=
often enough for this algorithm to pick up those connections.

The last example I've got on hand is that of [[https://paperscape.org/][Paperscape]], which comes closest
among these to what I've got in mind. Paperscape is an interactive map that
visualizes the arXiv  with papers "clustered together according to how they
reference each other... as particles in a physical system, with references
acting as attractive forces between papers".

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt alt-text here

[[file:a-map-of-mathematics/paperscape-map.jpg]]

I strongly recommend zooming in and panning around to see what famous papers you
recognize, and where they're positioned relative to others. I especially enjoy
the intricate coastlines and the sparse ocean of papers to the west of the main
math islands. The [[https://github.com/paperscape/paperscape-mapclient][code and data]] for the Paperscape project is available online.
While the map uses a large amount of data (papers between 1991 and 2017), the
authors note that references to non-arXiv articles cannot be reliably captured
in general -- indeed, on average only about 8% of references in math papers
could be linked to other arXiv papers. This might explain the large set of
sparsely distributed math papers. The ratio is much better in high energy
physics, sitting at around 70-80%. I guess this is an inevitable limitation of
any dataset focusing on online publications.

Now, when it comes to a map of mathematics, I think Paperscape is a bit /too/
granular. For such a map, we might want the finest resolution to be subfields
(or maybe sub-subfields) of mathematics. There are a few different ways to
classify papers/documents into mathematical subfields. If we were to restrict to
arXiv preprints, we could use the =math.XX= tags that are used to categorize
submissions, found [[https://arxiv.org/archive/math][here]], which I've scraped below:

#+begin_src sh

* the mathematics subject classification
There is a more granular classification than the arXiv's maintained by [[https://zbmath.org/about/][zbMATH
Open]] and the American Mathematical Society's [[https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/publications-search][Mathematical Reviews]], called the
*Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC)*. The most recent revision is called the
[[https://msc2020.org/][MSC2020]], and can be [[https://zbmath.org/classification/][browsed]] at zbMATH Open. The classification scheme is fairly
straightforward, consisting of 5-character MSC codes of the form =##X##=, where
the =#='s are digits and =X= is either a letter =A-Z= or a hyphen =-=. The first two
digits indicate the top-level mathematical subfield: documents classified as
algebraic topology, for instance, fall under =55X##=, while those classified under
partial differential equations are marked as =35X##=. The hyphen indicates a
document that does not directly contain research mathematics, while letters
indicate sub-subfield. The final two digits indicate with mathematical concepts
are treated. So, for example:
#+begin_quote
=35= / partial differential equations
 - =35-04= / software, source code, etc. for problems pertaining to partial differential equations
=55= / algebraic topology
 - =55-04= / software, source code, etc. for problems pertaining to algebraic topology
 - =55Q= / homotopy groups
   - =55Q10= / stable homotopy groups
   - =55Q40= / homotopy groups of spheres
#+end_quote

Now most research mathematics does not fit neatly into one of these full
five-digit boxes -- typically mathematicians use a wide variety of tools,
techniques, and tricks from various subfields to attack difficult problems.
Because of this, it's common to see quite a few codes attached to any given
paper. Take for instance, [[https://zbmath.org/1328.14027][this paper]], which sits roughly in the region
where algebraic geometry meets symplectic geometry and mathematical physics
(with a sprinkling of higher categories). It's tagged with:
#+begin_quote
=53D05= / symplectic manifolds (general theory)

=53D12= / lagrangian submanifolds; maslov index

=14A15= / schemes and morphisms

=18F20= / presheaves and sheaves, stacks, descent conditions (category-theoretic aspects)
#+end_quote
along with some older, outdated MSC2010 codes. Returning to the idea of building
a map of mathematics, we can think of this paper as a witness to the conceptual
proximity between these fields or ideas of mathematics. In the rest of this
article, we'll use the MSC and the data available from zbMATH Open to build a
map of mathematics based on MSC codes, with distances between two codes
determined by the presence of literature jointly tagged with those codes.

One benefit of using zbMATH Open is that their index is the most comprehensive
and long-running index available (as well as freely available to the public via
well-designed APIs and dataset releases). This does not, however, guarantee that
every reference is captured and/or classified. Take, for instance, the [[https://zbmath.org/0050.39304][series]] of
[[https://zbmath.org/0055.41704][landmark]] [[https://zbmath.org/0057.15302][papers]] by Eilenberg and Mac Lane that defined and studied what are now
known as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilenberg%E2%80%93MacLane_space][Eilenberg-MacLane spaces]] $K(G, n)$. There are no MSC codes assigned to
these papers,[fn:1] perhaps due to how old they are, having been published in the
1950's. In many fields of research, concern about the lack of much older
references might be justifiably brushed aside as newer papers often replace
older ones. Mathematics is a bit different, however, due in part to the
sociological nature of definitions and theorems as relatively immutable. We
might therefore expect research papers to hold more lasting influence when
measured in terms of citations. Indeed, analysis of citation datasets shows
evidence to support this hypothesis. In fact, mathematicians since the end of
World War 2 have been citing papers from relatively further and further back
in time [[cite:&zbMATH06853068]].

This is apparently /opposite/ the trend seen in most other research areas, which
marks mathematics as a bit of an oddball (and also indicates the irrelevance of
"impact factors" for mathematics, as they tend to focus only on recent
time-scales).

All that is to say: while the MSC data from zbMATH Open may be more
comprehensive than data from arXiv, there are still significant gaps and caveats
to keep in mind as we proceed.

* zbmath open data
zbMATH Open has a long and interesting [[https://zbmath.org/about/][history]], but only very recently -- as of
early 2021 -- has it become open access (it was formerly known as Zentralblatt
MATH), with the support of the German government [[cite:&zbMATH07278369]]. It is an
incredible source for tracking down mathematical research documents and even
includes links to the [[https://oeis.org/][OEIS]] and backrefs from [[https://mathoverflow.net/][MathOverflow]], among other things.
There is an [[https://oai.zbmath.org/][API]] for programmatic access[fn:2], but for our purposes it will be
easier to just use a bulk dataset provided on [[https://zenodo.org/record/6448360][Zenodo]]. The data is provided as a
=csv= that weighs in at around =1.6G=. I've repackaged the the data for myself as a
=parquet= which roughly halves the size (this is easy to do using =pandas=). The
columns in this dataset are labeled as follows:
#+begin_quote
=de= / eight digits internal zbMATH identifier

=doi= / digital object identifier

=msc= / MSC of the article

=keyword= / keywords of the article

=title= / title of the article

=refs= / MSCs occurring in the references
#+end_quote
There's actually an extra column called =text= that seems to contain the abstract,
but it's typically empty, and we won't be using it anyway.

Before we get to working with the data, let's make sure we've got a virtual
environment with all our packages ready to go.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :session py
(pyvenv-activate "../../.venv")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

We can now load the data into memory, only keeping columns we'll use.

#+begin_src python :session py
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
data_file = '~/data/zb.parquet.gzip'
cols = ['doi', 'msc', 'keyword', 'refs']
df = pd.read_parquet(data_file)[cols]
print(f"{df['msc'].isna().mean() * 100:0.1f}% of records missing MSC code, dropping...")
df = df[df['msc'].notna()]
print(f"{len(df)} records remaining.")
print(f"{df['refs'].isna().mean() * 100:0.1f}% of remaining records missing reference MSC codes, dropping...")
df = df[df['refs'].notna()]
print(f"{len(df)} records remaining.")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 11.2% of records missing MSC code, dropping...
: 3883360 records remaining.
: 72.5% of remaining records missing reference MSC codes, dropping...
: 1066151 records remaining.

As you can see, there's a large amount of missing data. We've restricted to only
those records that have non-trivial MSC data as well as non-trivial MSC data for
the documents they reference. This leaves us still with about a million rows. If
you look through the data, you'll find that the =msc= column needs to be cleaned a
bit, as there are some entries stored as lists (="['20M99', '20M18', '08A30']"=)
while others are stored as single-codes not in lists (="70F10"=).[fn:3] This is easy
to fix:

#+begin_src python
mask_not_lists = ~df['msc'].str.startswith('[')
df.loc[mask_not_lists, 'msc'] = '[\'' + df[mask_not_lists]['msc'] + '\']'
#+end_src

[fn:3] While =pandas= is convenient for quickly exploring data if you're working in a
python environment (especially with varied file formats such as =parquet=), I've
recently started using =xsv= (see [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv][here]]), which is a speedy little command line
utililty for working with =csv= files. To explore what some of the values in the
=msc= column look like, for instance, you could run:
#+begin_src sh
xsv select msc ~/Downloads/out.csv | xsv sample 10
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
msc
"['44A10', '30D55']"

"['82B41', '82B27', '60G50']"

"['70M20', '85-08']"

[fn:2] As zbMATH Open compiles data from various sources that may enforce a number
of different licenses, the API provides less data than is available on the web
interface, with data often replaced by the string =zbMATH Open Web Interface
contents unavailable due to conflicting licenses.= This is described in the API
[[https://oai.zbmath.org/][documentation]]. Examples of API queries can be found on zbMATH Open's Github [[https://github.com/zbMATHOpen/mscHarvester][here]].

[fn:1] It might be interesting to carry out an analysis of the distribution of MSC
codes in the literature. Not only in terms of the proportion of tagged documents
over time, but also to understand the subfield-by-subfield development and
evolution of research mathematics. This is, of course, a bit tricky because
while the MSC is quite old, it has changed substantially since the 1940s (see
[[https://web.archive.org/web/20230305101919/https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/help/field_help.html][here]], for instance).
