In Japanese, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yojijukugo][yojijukugo]] (四字熟語) are four-character kanji compounds that
sometimes have idiomatic meanings. Here are a few I've learned so far that I
found interesting.

- 前途多難（ぜんとたなん）: having many difficulties in store; grim prospects​
- 悪因悪果（あくいんあっか）: evil sowed, evil reaped
- 善因善果（ぜんいんぜんか）: good actions lead to good rewards; one good turn
  deserves another
- 一石二鳥（いっせきにちょう）: killing two birds with one stone
- 問答無用（もんどうむよう）：there being no use arguing about it
- 単刀直入（たんとうちょくにゅう）：straight to the point; frank; direct
- 文人墨客 （ぶんじんぼっかく）：writers and artists, those delighting in
  poetry, literature, painting, calligraphy, etc.
