This repository contains the code for my personal website.
Currently it can be found [[https://nilaykumar.github.io/][here]].

* website todo

The website's content is written in org-mode, and exported to markdown via
=ox-hugo= and then generated as a static site using =hugo=.

- [ ] figure out how to cleanly deal with image duplication: store images only
  in the static directory, and reference there from org?
- [ ] come up with a real website name
- [ ] change blog post property commands to property drawers at the top
  of this page: https://gohugo.io/content-management/cross-references/
- [ ] side-note table of contents (see the ox-hugo website for css, etc.)
- [ ] fix h4 and beyond (i don't really like the bold)
- [ ] note summaries?
- [ ] link to raw org mode file
- [ ] formulate a standard for images, keeping them as small as possible
- [ ] learn the basics of accessibility
- [ ] fix weird bibliography spacing on mnist post
- [ ] section anchors (c.f. https://scripter.co/sidenotes-using-ox-hugo/#code-snippet--sidenote-shortcode)
- [ ] write up explanation of how things work (for myself, mostly)
- [ ] learn an epsilon of how licensing works
- [ ] set up an RSS feed (only for the blog)
- [ ] look into adding back a pdfs page (links to various notes, etc. that
  people found useful). it's a bit out of place on the landing page
- [ ] export on save? automate deployment? c.f. https://ianhocking.com/prog/posts/githooks/
- [ ] detect dead links -- replace them automatically/manually with links to the
  internet archive (is there a tool to do this regularly and notify me?)
- [ ] move index pic into org dir and let ox-hugo move it
- [ ] remove unused/unnecessary css
