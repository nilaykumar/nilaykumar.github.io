Hi! I'm Nilay.

I'm a data scientist and former mathematician with pretty broad interests. I
like learning about and creating new things. Sometimes I write things down and
put them on my blog.

Recently I've been interested in [political economy](https://scienceforthepeople.org/), the climate, and the
[Japanese](https://nilay.ink/kanji-stroke-order/) language. I'm also starting to learn a bit about permacomputing, emacs,
and lisp.

You can get in touch with me via email [here](mailto:nilaykumar@tutanota.com). You can find the code for this site
[here](https://github.com/nilaykumar/nilaykumar.github.io).
