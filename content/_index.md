Hi! I'm Nilay.

I'm a data scientist and former mathematician with pretty broad interests. I
like learning about and creating new things. Sometimes I write things down and
put them on my blog.

Recently I've been reading a lot about political economy, as well as learning a
bit of Japanese in preparation for a trip to Japan.

You can get in touch with me via email [here](mailto:nilaykumar@tutanota.com). If you spot any mistakes on my
blog, please free free to open a [pull
request](https://github.com/nilaykumar/nilaykumar.github.io).
