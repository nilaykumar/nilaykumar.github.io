Hey, I'm Nilay.

I'm a data scientist and former mathematician with pretty broad interests. I
like learning about and creating new things. Sometimes I even write things down.

Recently I've been interested in [political economy](https://scienceforthepeople.org/), the climate, and the
[Japanese](https://nilay.ink/kanji-stroke-order/) language. I'm also starting to learn a bit about low-tech, emacs,
and C.

You can get in touch with me via email [here](mailto:nilaykumar@tutanota.com), and you can find the code for this
site on [GitHub](https://github.com/nilaykumar/nilaykumar.github.io).

Below are some math notes that might be of interest:

-   My Ph.D. [thesis](/pdf/nilay_kumar_thesis.pdf) in mathematical physics, written under the guidance of Ezra
    Getzler, concerns a new construction of the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) Laplacian
    using the methods of homological perturbation theory. Here are the [slides](/pdf/nilay_kumar_thesis_presentation.pdf) from
    my thesis defense. (August 3, 2021)
-   A [talk](/pdf/bott_simplicial_manifold.pdf) outlining Bott's [computation](https://doi.org/10.1016/0001-8708(73)90012-1) of differential forms on the classifying
    space of a compact Lie group G. I briefly describe how to view this
    computation as a concrete construction of a shifted symplectic structure (a la
    [Pantev-Toen-Vaquie-Vezzosi](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3209)) on the classifying stack BG represented by a
    simplicial manifold. I recommend Ezra Getzler's [exposition](/pdf/getzler_lesdiablerets_simplicial_manifolds.pdf) on simplicial
    manifolds as a general reference. (May 2019)
-   Rough notes on [lectures](/pdf/sms.pdf) given by various speakers on derived geometry at the Fields
    Institute. (Summer 2018)
-   Very unfinished notes on [differential cohomology and gerbes](/pdf/gerbes_unfinished_notes.pdf) in which I tried
    to keep things concrete and computational. Obviously, graduate students must
    be utterly perfect and never make mistakes, but I'm making these notes
    available because I've had multiple students ask me about where to find them.
    (January 2018)
-   Rough notes on Mihnea Popa's [course](/pdf/complex_geometry.pdf) on complex geometry. (Winter/Spring 2018)
-   Lightning [talk](/pdf/gss_talk.pdf) on the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. (September 22, 2017)
-   Rough notes from John Francis' course on [factorization homology](/pdf/factorization_homology.pdf). For a very
    high-level summary of main results, see [these notes](/pdf/facthom_talk.pdf). (Fall 2017)
-   Notes for a [talk](/pdf/chernweiltheory.pdf) on Chern-Weil theory in John Francis' Milnor seminar. (April
    10, 2017)
-   An informal reading group on WKB methods led to this [talk](/pdf/fukayaConjecture.pdf) on Witten's de Rham
    approach to Morse theory, and Fukaya's reinterpretation in terms of
    A-infinity categories. (March 22, 2017)
-   I gave a talk on the symplectic geometry behind [classical mechanics](/pdf/symplectic_background.pdf) (with an
    eye towards moment maps and Noether's theorem) for a seminar on the BV
    formalism, run by Sean Pohorence. (January 10, 2017)
-   In one of the many Kan seminars run by John Francis, I gave a talk sketching
    [Bousfield's construction](/pdf/bousfield_localization.pdf) of the localization of spaces with respect to
    homology equivalences. I seem to have avoided discussing all the hard parts of
    the construction. I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed. (November 30, 2016)
-   For a seminar on Reshetikin-Turaev invariants, led by Theo Johnson-Freyd, I
    gave a talk on the [geometric quantization](/pdf/gq_cs.pdf) of Chern-Simons theory (according to
    Axelrod, della Pietra, and Witten). (January 13, 2016)
-   I spent a bit of time learning about the basics of symplectic geometry as a
    first-year graduate student under Eric Zaslow's patient eye and I took some
    [notes](/pdf/notes_symp.pdf) in the process. (December 11, 2015)
