## marx's definition {#marx-s-definition}

Marx introduces the notion of commodity fetishism quite early in [Capital](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#S4).


## technology {#technology}

The material objects underlying the technologies with which we interact present
themselves as commodities, products of social labor:

> The problem comes when we fetishize technology by only seeing the object in
> front of us without considering any of the broader networks of social,
> political, and economic relationships that the object is embedded within. In
> other words, all the things that are behind what technology gets made, why it's
> made, where it's made, who it's made for, and all the consequences that follow
> from its being made.

Sadowski asks here a series of basic questions about the processes that hide
behind the physical device (for instance, an iPhone), which I think are worth
thinking about.
