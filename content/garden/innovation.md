## what is innovation? {#what-is-innovation}


### political and economic change {#political-and-economic-change}

The origin of the word was a surprise to me. On the one hand, Silicon Valley's
usage of the term innovation is still consistent with this medieval definition,
as their brash move-fast-and-break-things approach has indeed heralded massive
political and economic changes (whether the rest of us wanted it or not). These
changes have in many ways been for the worse when it comes to the working class
(platformization, enshittification, gig economies, ...). On the other hand,
instead of bringing down the empire,

They are pointing out precisely this class character of Silicon Valley's
so-called "disruptive innovations", which unravels the seeming paradox posed by
the question.


### innovation sublime {#innovation-sublime}

Sadowski, in _The Mechanic and the Luddite_, takes a different approach. He
approaches innovation-as-idea:

> It is a value that people prioritize over most others. It is a goal people
> strive to acheive. It is an end that justifies almost any means necessary...
> Innovation is a fetish: an object of obsession. Innovation is a feeling: a sense
> of the sublime.

This is innovation as viewed through the rose-tinted, venture-capital backed
Silicon Valley metaverse goggles. Sadowski urges us to descend from the idea-l
and return to the material:

> Innovation is not a timeless category that exists across all space-time but is
> instead the product of its context. That context determines the creation and
> application, purpose and value of things marked as innovations.

In our present neoliberal capitalist context, innovations are LLM-powered search
engines that are [confidently wrong more than 60% of the time](https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/we-compared-eight-ai-search-engines-theyre-all-bad-at-citing-news.php) and short-term
rental platforms that destroy housing markets. Our societies' notion of
innovation is not worked out democratically, Sadowski notes, but instead
"defined by what fits into [a VC's] portfolio of investments. Progress becomes
defined by what aligns with their profit motive." (p54) Again, the class
character of innovation is transparently clear.


### culturally constructed {#culturally-constructed}

Wang provides an example of the historical and contextual contingency of
innovation in arguing that the distinct cultural notions of innovation in China
prevented Western tech companies from taking off there:

> Companies like eBay floundered in China, straining under the local advantage
> that Taobao had in understanding the Chinese market. Key details were missed,
> including the fact that eBay brokers secondhand goods, but in China, buying
> secondhand goods, especially clothing, is frowned upon... The great innovators
> of the United States found that innovation was culturally constructed.

This is an interesting argument, although Wang doesn't provide too much more
evidence to support it directly. I don't doubt that culture is a significant
influence, however, and much of their book is implicitly supporting evidence for
the claim.
