In Japanese, [yojijukugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yojijukugo) (四字熟語) are four-character kanji compounds that
sometimes have idiomatic meanings. Here are a few I've learned so far that I
found interesting.

-   前途多難（ぜんとたなん）: having many difficulties in store; grim prospects
-   悪因悪果（あくいんあっか）: evil sowed, evil reaped
-   善因善果（ぜんいんぜんか）: good actions lead to good rewards; one good turn
    deserves another
-   一石二鳥（いっせきにちょう）: killing two birds with one stone
